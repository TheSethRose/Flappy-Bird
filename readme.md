# Flappy Bird Replica

This is a simple implementation of the Flappy Bird Replica using Pygame, developed with the help of You.com AI assistants.

## Development Process

The development of this Flappy Bird Replica was made possible by leveraging the power of You.com AI assistants. Here's an overview of the process:

1. **Project Scoping**: I created a You.com assistant specifically for breaking down and scoping projects. This assistant helped me define the requirements and plan the development of the Flappy Bird Replica.

2. **AI Developer**: I created another You.com assistant to act as an AI Developer. This assistant was given the goal of creating the Flappy Bird Replica based on the project scope and requirements.

3. **Asset Provision**: I provided the AI Developer with the necessary sprite images for the game, including the bird, pipes, background, and other visual elements.

4. **Iterative Development**: The AI Developer worked on creating the game, iterating and refining the code based on my feedback and suggestions. The development process took approximately one hour in total.

## Game Features

The Flappy Bird Replica developed by the AI Developer includes the following features:

- Simple and intuitive gameplay mechanics
- Randomly generated pipes for endless gameplay
- Realistic bird physics and animations
- Game over screen with restart and quit options
- Smooth scrolling background and ground
- Engaging sound effects and visual feedback

## Requirements

To run the Flappy Bird Replica, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TheSethRose/Flappy-Bird.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd flappy-bird
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

## How to Play

- Press the spacebar to make the bird flap and navigate through the pipes.
- Avoid colliding with the pipes and the ground.
- The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
- After the game ends, you can choose to restart the game or quit.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the game, make sure that:

- You have installed the required dependencies (Python and Pygame).
- The image assets are located in the correct directory (`assets/`).
- The file paths in the code are correct and pointing to the right locations.

If you still face any problems, please open an issue on the GitHub repository, and I'll be happy to assist you.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for future enhancements to the Flappy Bird Replica:

- Add a scoring system to keep track of the player's progress.
- Implement different difficulty levels with varying pipe speeds and gaps.
- Include power-ups or bonus items to make the gameplay more exciting.
- Enhance the visual and sound effects for a more immersive experience.
